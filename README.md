# 🌾 Government Crop Production Analytics Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Government Crop Production Analytics Dashboard** is an AI-powered agricultural decision support system developed using Machine Learning.  
This system predicts crop production based on crop type, season, cost of cultivation, and location (state & district).

It is designed to simulate a government-level agricultural analytics platform that helps in crop planning, yield forecasting, and data-driven decision making.
